# Traffic Light Simulator

A simple C program that simulates a traffic light system by taking a color as input and printing the corresponding action.

The program prompts the user to enter a color (red, yellow, or green). It then determines the correct action based on the input:

- "red" → "Stop"
- "yellow" → "Slow down"
- "green" → "Go"
